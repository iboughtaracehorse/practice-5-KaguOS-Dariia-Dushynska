summary:

This was originally meant to be a game about horses.
But after a scientific experiment, a tragic truth was discovered: horses are not compatible with bitmaps. No matter how hard we tried, they ended up looking like cursed LEGO creatures.

For the sake of everyone's sanity, we made the brave decision to abandon horses and embrace the much more drawable world of cats and vampire rats.
